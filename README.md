# Male Factor Infertility and Adverse Outcomes in the UK Biobank
### By Dylan Peterson, Erika Malaspina, and Foster Birnbaum

Welcome to the github page for our project seeking to identify and characterize the health implications 
of AZF microdeletions in the UK Biobank to better understand the health impacts of Male Factor Infertility!

NOTE: Unfortunately due to concerns about datasharing and encryption, we are not able to upload the necessary datasets to run the following code.
We will work on generating simulated data from which one could run these files.
